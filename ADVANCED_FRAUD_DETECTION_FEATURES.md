### Example Detection:
```
üìç Transaction: Mumbai ‚Üí London in 2 minutes
   Distance: 7191.7 km
   Minimum travel time: 9.0 hours

### Pattern Detection:
1. **Rapid High-Value Transactions**: Multiple high-value transactions within 24 hours
2. **Geographic Jumps**: Transactions from multiple different locations
3. **Late Night Patterns**: Unusual frequency of late-night transactions
4. **Amount Escalation**: Consistently increasing transaction amounts

### Example Output:
```
‚è∞ Rapid high-value transaction pattern:
   Sequence anomaly score: 0.000
   Temporal patterns detected: 4
   - rapid_high_value: Multiple high-value transactions within 24 hours (severity: 0.80)
   - geographic_jumps: Transactions from 5 different locations (severity: 0.60)
   - late_night_pattern: 70.0% transactions during late night hours (severity: 0.70)

```

## üåê External Intelligence Integration

### Features Implemented:
- **Merchant Risk Database**: Comprehensive database of merchant risk scores and categories
- **IP Reputation Analysis**: Checks IP addresses for reputation, VPN usage, and geographic location
- **Dark Web Monitoring**: Scans for indicators of dark web activity
- **Location-IP Mismatch Detection**: Identifies discrepancies between transaction location and IP origin
- **Real-time Risk Scoring**: Combines multiple external intelligence sources

### Intelligence Sources:
1. **Merchant Risk**: Categories include gambling, crypto, banking, retail, etc.
2. **IP Reputation**: Reputation scores, VPN detection, geographic origin
3. **Dark Web Flags**: Suspicious emails, phone numbers, merchant names, locations
4. **Location Mismatch**: Compares transaction location with IP country

### Example Analysis:
```
üåê Suspicious transaction analysis:
   Merchant: Dark Web Market
   IP: 185.220.101.1 (VPN/Proxy: True)
   Email: fraudster@darkmail.com
   Dark web flags: ['suspicious_email', 'suspicious_phone', 'dark_web_merchant']
   Total external risk: 0.935
```

## üîç Comprehensive Risk Scoring

### Multi-Layer Analysis:
1. **Machine Learning Models**: Classical Random Forest + Quantum Neural Network
2. **Sequential Analysis**: Markov chains, sequence anomalies, temporal patterns
3. **Geolocation Analysis**: Distance calculations, travel time, cross-border risk
4. **External Intelligence**: Merchant risk, IP reputation, dark web monitoring
5. **Traditional Risk Factors**: Amount ratios, location risk, merchant risk, time risk

### Weighted Risk Combination:
```python
weights = {
    'ml_risk': 0.25,
    'sequential_risk': 0.25,
    'geolocation_risk': 0.2,
    'external_risk': 0.2,
    'traditional_risk': 0.1
}
```

### Example Comprehensive Detection:
